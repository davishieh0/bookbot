## üîß How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: Reads the entire book file into memory
2. **Word Counting**: Splits text by whitespace and counts words
3. **Character Analysis**: Converts all characters to lowercase and counts frequency
4. **Sorting**: Orders characters by frequency (most common first)
5. **Filtering**: Shows only alphabetic characters in the final report

## üéØ Functions Overview

### `main.py`
- `getBookText(pathToFile)` - Reads file contents
- `main()` - Main application logic

### `stats.py`
- `getNumWords(book)` - Counts total words
- `getCharsDict(text)` - Analyzes character frequency
- `sortCharacterCounts(characterCounts)` - Sorts characters by frequency

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling

BookBot gracefully handles common errors:

- **File Not Found**: Clear message when the specified file doesn't exist
- **Permission Denied**: Helpful error when file permissions are insufficient
- **Unexpected Errors**: Logs unknown errors for debugging
